The checkpoints are converted to the CTranslate2 format and weight-quantized
to INT8. They are not fine-tuned or otherwise trained by this project. The
archive preserves each upstream model card, includes the Apache License 2.0
text plus the FuguMT creator/source/change notice and CC BY-SA 4.0 legal-code
links, and records source revisions and per-file SHA-256 hashes in
`manifest.json`. The converted FuguMT model files remain under CC BY-SA 4.0;
the OPUS-MT model remains under Apache 2.0.

CTranslate2 is an MIT-licensed conversion and inference runtime:
